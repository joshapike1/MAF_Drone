# MAF_Drone
A DJI app which allows a user to save waypoint missions.

To use this application the user must have a Mac running the latest version of iOS and Xcode. The user must also install the DJI SDK
following the steps provided in this link: https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/application-development-workflow/workflow-integrate.html#register-application
and have an active DJI developer account.

Once these steps are completed the user should be able to clone the entire repo to where they installed the SDK.

Thanks :) Feel free to ask questions in the comments.
